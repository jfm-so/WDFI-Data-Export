# WDFI-Data-Export

Wisconsin Department of Financial Instution data exports are delivered in a Microfiche fixed-length ASCII file that can not be read by any database program. 

The Pascal script is intended to convert this archaic file into a mySQL database. 

The following variables in source.pas need to be updated before running.

- unicon1.Server := '';
- unicon1.Database := '';
- unicon1.Username := '';
- unicon1.Password := '';
